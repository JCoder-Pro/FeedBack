# Feedback to help us be better

Welcome to the [JCoder](https://oj.cse.sustech.edu.cn) feedback repository, a place connecting you with the JCoder developers.

You are welcome to report bugs you encountered when using JCoder, or to share your comments, suggestions, or ideas about JCoder here.

## Check the following Q&A first

### 1. "I believe that a mistake exists in a test case of an assignment problem. Should I leave my feedback here?"

No. This repository is for collecting feedback regarding the JCoder system itself instead of the assignment questions published there. For problems related to a specific assignment question, it would be more effective for you to contact the instructor or teaching assistants.

### 2. "I fail to login after I changed my password. Must I post my account information here to provide diagnostic information?"

No, you don't need to. For problems concerning any specific account, we have created a private feedback form to protect your privacy. Please refer to <https://docs.qq.com/form/page/DQ1VEZnpOdXdjZ3Zk?_w_tencentdocx_form=1>.

The private feedback approach is also more suitable for reporting security bugs.

### 3. "I found an existing issue describing the same problem I am faced with. Should I create a new issue or simply reply to the existing one?"

You are suggested to comment the existing issue that are open.

### 4. "I was noticed that the verification email has been sent successfully while changing password, but I cannot find the mail in my box. What's wrong?"

The email system of the OJ is driven by our personal email account since SUSTech hasn't provided permission for us to create a public email account. Thus, if there are so many password changing requests during a short period, our email account will be banned to send email for some hours due to be judged as AD publisher or some other reasons.

So, if you are not hurry in changing your password, you might be able to try again after hours. Otherwise please fill in the feedback sheet shown under the Q2 before. Thank you for your cooperation.
