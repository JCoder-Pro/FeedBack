# Feedback to help us be better

Welcome to the [JCoder](https://oj.sustech.xyz) feedback repository, a place connecting you with the JCoder developers.

You are welcome to report bugs you encountered when using JCoder, or to share your comments, suggestions, or ideas about JCoder here.

## Check the following Q&A first

### 1. "I believe that a mistake exists in a test case of an assignment problem. Should I leave my feedback here?"

No. This repository is for collecting feedback regarding the JCoder system itself instead of the assignment questions published there. For problems related to a specific assignment question, it would be more effective for you to contact the instructor or teaching assistants.

### 2. "I fail to login after I changed my password. Must I post my account information here to provide diagnostic information?"

No, you don't need to. For problems concerning any specific account, we have created a private feedback form to protect your privacy. Please refer to <https://docs.qq.com/form/page/DQ1VEZnpOdXdjZ3Zk?_w_tencentdocx_form=1>.

The private feedback approach is also more suitable for reporting security bugs.

### 3. "I found an existing issue describing the same problem I am faced with. Should I create a new issue or simply reply to the existing one?"

You are suggested to comment the existing issue that are open.
